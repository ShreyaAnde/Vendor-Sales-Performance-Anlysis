# 📊 Vendor & Inventory Performance Analysis  

## 📝 Problem Statement  
Effective inventory and sales management are critical for optimizing profitability in the retail and wholesale industry. Companies need to ensure they are not incurring losses due to inefficient pricing, poor inventory turnover, or vendor dependency.  

The main objectives of this project are:  
- Identify **underperforming brands** requiring promotional or pricing adjustments.  
- Determine **top vendors** contributing to sales and gross profit.  
- Analyze the **impact of bulk purchasing** on unit costs.  
- Assess **inventory turnover** to reduce holding costs and improve efficiency.  
- Investigate the **profitability variance** between high-performing and low-performing vendors.

## 🔍 Approach  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing.  
   - Sales, cost, and profit distribution analysis.  
   - Inventory movement and vendor performance visualization.  

2. **Vendor Performance Analysis**  
   - Ranking vendors by revenue and gross profit.  
   - Identifying vendors with negative/low profitability.  
   - Evaluating contribution margins.  

3. **Inventory & Pricing Insights**  
   - Correlation between bulk purchase and unit cost reduction.  
   - Stock turnover evaluation for efficient working capital use.  
   - Detection of slow-moving inventory.

## 📈 Key Findings & Results  
- **Top Vendors:** A small number of vendors contribute to the majority of gross profit (Pareto effect observed).  
- **Underperforming Vendors:** Some vendors consistently generate sales but low or negative profit margins → require renegotiation or promotional strategies.  
- **Bulk Purchases:** Larger purchase quantities generally lowered per-unit costs, improving profit margins.  
- **Inventory Turnover:** Certain brands showed **low turnover rates**, tying up capital and increasing holding costs.  
- **Profitability Variance:** High-performing vendors had significantly better contribution margins compared to underperformers, highlighting the need for vendor management.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data exploration & analysis  
- **Power BI (optional)**: For dashboarding & visualization  
- **Excel/CSV**: Raw dataset source  

---

## 🚀 Future Scope  
- Implement **predictive models** for demand forecasting and vendor performance.  
- Build a **dashboard (Power BI / Streamlit)** for real-time inventory and vendor monitoring.  
- Introduce **what-if analysis** for pricing and promotional strategies.  
- Automate alerts for slow-moving or loss-making products/vendors.
